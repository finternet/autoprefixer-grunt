# autoprefixer-grunt
This is just a simple way to setup auto-prefixer for your project (this time without using Grunt). All you need to do is:

1. Install NodeJS
2. Clone this project and copy the content into your project folder
3. Open the command prompt (or Terminal window) and run `npm install`
4. Configure 'package.json' file and add related build steps
5. Run `watch "npm run build" ./less` into command prompt (or Terminal window) or click on `watchall.bat` to run automatically

This might look a bit more complicated than previous grunt version, but it will work better and has less dependencies. Also you can easily add more plug-ins to it.
